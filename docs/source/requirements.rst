Minimum requirements
--------------------

If you want to run the datalogger without the need of writing code, this is what you'll need:
 * Hardware that is:

  * capable of running linux.
  * able to read sensors:

    * via serial port with a modbus level convertor.
    * via I2C from a arduino compatible microcontroller.
  
  * able to connect to the internet periodically.

Notes:
It is possible to extend the software to read the data from elsewhere.
Interesting hardware to log data are low cost, energy efficient ARM boards like the raspberry pi or the cubieboard.
